I'm a Software Engineer/Developer, though I usually say I'm a hacker, tinkerer or builder. I've worked with different small companies and start-ups since 2015. I love working with Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning algorithms to understand more about data and logic. It's a lot of fun for me to try to come up with useless solutions to problems that no one cares about. I'm always up for a challenge to figure out something new. 

In my spare time I am also an avid climber. As well as trying to challenge my mind, I also try to challenge my body. I love spreading the joy of both climbing and programming by helping others. 



I was born and raised in Philadelphia. I love my city and I want to help it how I can. We have a lot go good schools here but most people end up leaving to go to other places for work after school. I want to stay in Philly to try to row the tech scene here. 

Programming has always been a passion of mine. I love trying to figure out how to make things work. I like to do a lot of work with back end systems and algorithms. I've started a few different projects on GitHub to try to learn new stuff. I love the data and logic side of programming. I usually try to shy away from the design and front end side of programming. I always struggle with HTML and CSS. go ahead inspect this page. You'll probably see that it is all really basic HTML with no CSS. 

I have always loved to learn and try new things. I am currently learning a lot about robotics with RaspberryPi. I have learned a lot in the past year about rock climbing. I want to learn how to ride a motorcycle and maybe fly a plane. I want to learn how to fix a car engine. And I can't count how many times I fell down a Wikipedia rabbit hole.
