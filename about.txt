I'm a Software Engineer/Developer, though I usually say I'm a hacker, tinkerer or builder. I've worked with different small companies and start-ups since 2015. I love working with Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning algorithms to understand more about data and logic. It's a lot of fun for me to try to come up with useless solutions to problems that no one cares about. I'm always up for a challenge to figure out something new. 

In my spare time I am also an avid climber. As well as trying to challenge my mind, I also try to challenge my body. I love spreading the joy of both climbing and programming by helping others.
